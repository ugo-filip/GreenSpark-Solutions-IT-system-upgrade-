As project manager, I was responsible for creating a comprehensive budget and resource allocation plan for hardware upgrades, cloud migration, software licensing, training, and contingency funds.

Action:
I structured the project as follows:

Estimated Costs:

Hardware upgrades ($80,000 - $125,000), cloud storage, and software licenses ($35,000 - $60,000), and training ($10,000 - $20,000).

Allocated a $20,000 contingency fund for unexpected challenges.

Resource Allocation:

Deployed internal IT staff for hardware and software integration (6-8 weeks).

Engaged external vendors for cloud migration and software implementation.
